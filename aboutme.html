<h1> Favorite book- Wings of Fire </h1>
<p> Wings of Fire is the autobiography of the former President of India, Dr. Abdul Kalam. Kalam went from being a humble boy in South India to developing India's nuclear weapons and becoming President. Through this autobiography, the reader gains a glimpse into pre-partition India. Kalam also exposes readers to the positive thinking and ideas that helped him become such a success. 
    This is the story of Kalam's rise from obscurity and his personal and professional struggles. It is also a saga of independent India's struggle for technological self-sufficiency and defensive autonomy. It is almost impossible not to be inspired by the life of Mr. Kalam </p>
