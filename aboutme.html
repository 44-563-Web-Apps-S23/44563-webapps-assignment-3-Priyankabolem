<h1> Favorite book- Wings of Fire </h1>
<p> Wings of Fire is the autobiography of the <b>former President of India,</b> Dr. Abdul Kalam. 
    Kalam went from being a humble boy in <b>South India</b> to developing India's nuclear weapons 
    and becoming President. Through this autobiography, the reader gains a glimpse into pre-partition 
    India. Kalam also exposes readers to the positive thinking and ideas that helped him become 
    such a success. This is the story of Kalam's rise from obscurity and his personal and professional struggles. It is also a saga of independent India's struggle for technological self-sufficiency and defensive autonomy. It is almost impossible not to be inspired by the life of Mr. Kalam </p>
